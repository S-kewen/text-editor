### OOSE Team Work 1
- Due by 11/09/2020 (Oral presentation on 11/11/2020, 11/12/2020)
* 1. Please implement design patterns including composite, iterator, strategy, decorator, factory method /simple factory, abstract factory, bridge, and visitor to the Document Editor App discussed in the textbook and write the executable code in Java with annotations.
* 2. Highlight/mark the applied patterns in the class diagram and display some snapshots of the result in the report.
* 3. Internet of Things (IoT) is the set of technologies that can interconnect anything, from daily life objects to more sophisticated networked devices. Following the social networks paradigm, IoT-centric social networks would allow sharing of devices between users that would provide useful information captured by sensor devices or giving ways to make remote actions on user devices. Each group shall determine the application topic related to sharing IoT resources. The scope should not be too large, it should be feasible, and please take the issue of security protection into consideration.
  1) Please propose an approach that allows easily reusing highly distributed IoT resources by building services on top of a service platforms distributed and hosted in the Cloud that grants secure access to the data.
  2) Your proposal shall address project introduction and draw a use case diagram.
  3) Draw a detailed sequence diagram based on the use case you selected, or some aspects of the system.
* 4. The team members shall decide who acts as the team leader. The team leader is to help task assignment and team coordination. The code and a participation summary of team members shall be attached with the report to turn in. The team work will be evaluated based on completeness, correctness and usability of the design. The team work will be given a letter grade as A, B, C, D, or E.
